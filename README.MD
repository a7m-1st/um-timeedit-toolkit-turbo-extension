## Installation & Setup
[![Watch the video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/_5jY8XW82CE/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5jY8XW82CE)
1. Select the latest release, install the *dist.zip* and unzip it.
2. Go to extensions by `chrome://extensions` and click on *Load unpacked*.
3. Select the unzipped /dist folder from (1) to load it.
3. Navigate to `https://cloud.timeedit.net/my_um/web/students/` and the extension should popup when loaded successfully.

## Building Blocks for Timetable Applications

This toolkit interacts with the TimeEdit API to provide essential data for timetable software development. It offers the following key functionalities:

1.  **Comprehensive Module Catalog Retrieval:** Fetches an exhaustive list of all modules available within the UM TimeEdit system. This includes courses, events and other relevant entities, providing a complete inventory for application development.
2.  **Detailed Module Information Acquisition:** Retrieves in-depth specifications for each module. This encompasses crucial details like module codes, descriptions, and any other pertinent metadata necessary for enriching timetable applications.
3.  **Event Data Extraction:** Gathers all scheduled events (reservations) linked to each module. This core functionality provides the raw timetable data, including timings, dates, locations, and event types (e.g., Lecture, Tutorial), essential for building scheduling features.
4.  **Raw Data Export (JSON):** Facilitates the download of all extracted data into a single `course_events_with_details.json` file directly within the browser environment. This raw JSON output serves as the initial dataset for further processing and application integration.
5.  **Structured Data Refinement (Node.js):** Includes a `cleaner.js` script (Node.js) to transform the raw JSON data into a more organized and application-ready `timetable_data.json` file. This process restructures the data for efficient programmatic access and simplifies the development of timetable functionalities.

## Getting Started with the UM TimeEdit Toolkit Turbo Extension

This guide will help you get the UM TimeEdit Toolkit Turbo extension up and running in your Chrome browser for development and testing.

### Prerequisites

-   Google Chrome Engine Browsers: This extension is designed for Chrome Engine browsers (Ms Edge, Chrome etc...).
-   Node.js and npm: You'll need Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed to build the extension. Download them from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/).
-   A Text Editor or IDE: Choose your preferred code editor (e.g., VS Code, Sublime Text, Atom).

### Installation Steps

1.  **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/a7m-1st/um-timeedit-toolkit-turbo-extension.git
    cd um-timeedit-toolkit-turbo-extension/sch-ext
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

    This command installs all the necessary packages defined in the `package.json` file.

3.  **Build the Extension:**

    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

    This command uses webpack (configured in `webpack.config.js`) to bundle the extension's code into the `dist` directory.

4.  **Load the Extension in Chrome:**

    a.  Open Browser and go to `chrome://extensions`.

    b.  Enable "Developer mode" in the top right corner.

    c.  Click "Load unpacked" and select the `dist` directory inside `um-timeedit-toolkit-turbo-extension/sch-ext`. (The full path will look something like `C:/Users/ASUS/Desktop/Personal Projects/um-timeedit-toolkit-turbo-extension/sch-ext/dist`)

5.  **Using the Extension:**

    a.  Navigate to the Universiti Malaya TimeEdit website (`https://cloud.timeedit.net/my_um/web/students/`).

    b.  Log in with your UM credentials.

    c.  The extension should now be active. Click the extension icon in the Chrome toolbar to open the popup.

    d.  Enter the desired number of items to fetch and click "Fetch Courses".

    e. Upon successful script completion, the browser will automatically download a file named `course_events_with_details.json` to your browser's default download directory. This file contains the raw, extracted data in JSON format, ready for the next phase.

### Troubleshooting

-   "Could not load extension" error: Double-check that you selected the `dist` directory when loading the unpacked extension. Also, ensure that your `manifest.json` file is correctly formatted.
-   Extension not working on TimeEdit website: Make sure you are logged in to the correct TimeEdit URL (`https://cloud.timeedit.net/my_um/web/students/`). Also, verify that the `host_permissions` in your `manifest.json` include this URL.
-   Content script not injecting: Check the background script (`scripts/background.ts`) and content script (`scripts/contentScript.ts`) for any errors. Use `console.log` statements to debug. Also, ensure that the content script is correctly specified in the `web_accessible_resources` section of `manifest.json`.

### Development

-   Automatic Rebuilds: Run `npm run watch` to automatically rebuild the extension whenever you make changes to the source code. You'll need to manually reload the extension in Chrome (`chrome://extensions`) to see the updates.

### Note on Turbo Mode

1.  When `turboMode` is disabled (`false`), concurrency is applied only between batches. Therefore, modules within each batch are not sorted.
2.  When `turboMode` is enabled (`true`), full concurrency is applied, and the extracted modules are not sorted.

### Phase 2: Data Structuring with `cleaner.js` (Node.js Environment)

To facilitate efficient application development, the raw data from Phase 1 requires structuring. The `cleaner.js` script, executed using Node.js, transforms `course_events_with_details.json` into a more developer-friendly `timetable_data.json` file.

**`timetable_data.json` Structure for Application Development:**

`timetable_data.json` is designed to be **module-centric**, grouping events by module code. This structure simplifies data access and manipulation within your timetable applications. Within each module, activities are further categorized by type (e.g., "Lecture," "Tutorial"). Each activity type then contains an array of scheduled events, including time, day, and room details. This hierarchical structure is optimized for building features such as module-based timetable views, conflict detection, and personalized scheduling tools.

**Execution Instructions for `cleaner.js`:**

1.  **Node.js Requirement:** Ensure you have Node.js installed on your system.
2.  **Run `cleaner.js` in Terminal:** Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory containing `cleaner.js` and `course_events_with_details.json`, and execute the following command:

    ```bash
    node cleaner.js course_events_with_details.json
    ```

    This command will process the raw data and generate `timetable_data.json` in the same directory, providing you with the structured data ready for integration into your UM timetable application.
